# Buyers ID Manual Project

This project aims to fine-tune a language model to extract narrative profiles of individuals in the state of Georgia who create demand for human trafficking.

Rather than summarizing entire studies, the model is designed to extract and generate descriptive profiles based on information found within research reports. These profiles may include demographic characteristics, behavioral patterns, personal beliefs, or other traits, depending on the focus of each study.

The training data consists of long-form documents (often 20+ pages), and the model learns to identify and assemble relevant details into coherent representations of the individuals driving demand.

This work supports research, policy, and intervention efforts by providing deeper insights into who these buyers are and how they are characterized across multiple sources.
